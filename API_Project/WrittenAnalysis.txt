This project pulled data from the OpenWeather API.
It randomly selected 666 coordinates with valid cities located close to them.
I plotted Lattitude VS several weather variables, including Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity, and Cloudiness.
Three trends that showed up follow:
1. There appears to be a very clear coorelation between Lattitude and Temperature. The further away form the qeuator, the cooler the temperature.
2. The relationship between humidity and latitude is less clear. It appears that the data clusters around high aread of humidity both close to the qeuator - 0 deg lattitude - and close to the pole - 180 deg lat. The lowest humidity is clearly in the middle lattitudes.
3. There does not seem to be a discernable trend between lattitude and wind speed, however I suspect that this data would vary form day-to-day based on storm patterns. How example, a hurricant system near the equator may influence this and cause a coorelation with higher verage winds along lower latitudes.
